Sporting Clube de Portugal, otherwise referred to as Sporting CP or simply Sporting, is a Portuguese sports club based in Lisbon. Having various sports departments and sporting disciplines, it is best known for its men's professional football team playing in the Primeira Liga, the top flight of Portuguese football. Founded on 1 July 1906, Sporting is one of the "Big Three" clubs in Portugal that have never been relegated from Primeira Liga, along with rivals Benfica and Porto. Sporting are nicknamed Leões (Lions), for the symbol atop the club's crest, and Verde e brancos (Green and whites), for the shirt colours. The club's home ground has been the Estádio José Alvalade, built in 2003, which replaced the previous one built in 1956.
