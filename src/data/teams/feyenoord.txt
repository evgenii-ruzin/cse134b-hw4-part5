Feyenoord Rotterdam is a Dutch professional football club based in Rotterdam, which plays in the Eredivisie, the top tier in Dutch football. Founded as Wilhelmina in 1908, the club changed to various names before settling on being called after its neighbourhood in 1912 as Feyenoord, from the Feijenoord district in Rotterdam, and is locally referred to as Feyenoord. Since 1937, Feyenoord's home ground has been the Stadion Feijenoord, nicknamed De Kuip ('the Tub'), the second largest stadium in the Netherlands. Feyenoord is one of the most successful clubs in Dutch football, winning sixteen Eredivisie titles, fourteen KNVB Cups, and one UEFA Cup, which the club won in 1974.
