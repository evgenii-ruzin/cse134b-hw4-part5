Luka Modrić (born 9 September 1985) is a Croatian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for La Liga club Real Madrid and captains the Croatia national team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time and one of the greatest players of his generation. Born in Zadar, Modrić's childhood coincided with the Croatian War of Independence which displaced his family. After showing promise in his hometown club NK Zadar's youth team, he was signed by Dinamo Zagreb at age 16, where he won three consecutive league titles. In 2012, he joined Real Madrid for a transfer fee of €30 million. With Madrid, he won six UEFA Champions League titles, five La Liga titles, and numerous other honours. Modrić won the Ballon d'Or in 2018, becoming the first player other than Messi or Ronaldo to claim the award in more than a decade.
