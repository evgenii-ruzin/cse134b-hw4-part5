Son Heung-min (born 8 July 1992) is a South Korean professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur and the South Korea national team. Considered one of the best players in the world and widely regarded as the greatest Asian footballer of all time, he is known for his explosive speed, finishing, two-footedness, and ability to link play. Born in Chuncheon, Son relocated to Germany to join Hamburger SV at 16, for which he made his debut in the German Bundesliga in 2010. In 2013, he moved to Bayer Leverkusen for a club record €10 million, before signing for Tottenham for £22 million two years later, becoming the most expensive Asian player in history. At Tottenham, he has been the club's top scorer for three consecutive seasons and won the Premier League Golden Boot in 2022.
